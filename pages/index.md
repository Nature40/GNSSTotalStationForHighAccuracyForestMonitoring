# Welcome to the Survey Documentation

To get accurate and reproducable measurements with the GNSS system, one has to be familiar with technical terms, setup and measurement protocols.
This is a collection of technical tutorials and guides covering the usage of the GNSS and Totalstation.
Look at the [GNSS Document Collection](docs) for an overview.

Documentations about ecological data and the overall tree survey can be found in the [Survey Collection](survey)
