# Tree attributes in the survey campaign 2020

## Workflow in the forest

#### 0. Number
Nail number plate into tree stem and or read number on tree. Shout number to person at TPS.

#### 1. Tree species
Determine tree species in winter condition according to Schulz 2013.

#### 2. DBH
Determine 1.3 m. For different tree and slope situations see Fig. 1. If the measurement is not taken in 1.3, write down the measured height. Remove big mosses, dirt, etc. before measuring the diameter. Determine diameter of trees using a measuring tape rectangular to stem axis.

#### 3. Vitality after Roloff
Step back and look at the upper canopy using binoculars. Vitality can be determined by structure of branching (long and short shoots) according to Roloff 2001, see Fig. 2 for beech and Fig. 3 for oak.

#### 4. Social position after Kraft 
From the same position as in 3 look at the canopy volumes, ratio of sun exposed and shaded parts of the canopy and diameter of the stems of the target tree and surrounding trees. Determine class according to Kraft (1884), Fig. 4.

#### 5. Microhabitats
Look at the tree from different directions and scan for microhabitat structures using binoculars. Write down everything which can’t be found on a “perfect” tree. Use abbreviations shown in Tab. 1.

#### 6. Marking
Mark the tree with a yellow marker tape. Remove tapes when whole area is finished.
