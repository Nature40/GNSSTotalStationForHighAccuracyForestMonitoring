# Useful thoughts and terms for the DGPS



We are using the Sapos Service of Hesse via mobile signal  to get 
correction data for the GPS signal. Details about the service can be 
found [here](http://sapos.hvbg.hessen.de/info.php). There is also a 
useful [glossary](http://sapos.hvbg.hessen.de/info.php) about some 
terms. In Marburg there is a station which sends the correction signals 
in the *Amt fuer Bodenmagament* in the Robert-Koch-Strasse ([more 
info](http://sapos.hvbg.hessen.de/refmap.php?detail=0453)).



## Making good measurements

There are three quality modes of GPS measurements: _Autonomous, RTK Float 
and RTK Fix.
