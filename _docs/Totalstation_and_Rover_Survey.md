# Totalstation Setup with DGPS Rover

To get startet with the measurements with the totalstation, you have to know the exact position of the station.
For this, you can use the DGPS to identify exact positions of the prism reflector which you then measure with the totalstation.


## Connecting the equipment

Total station (TS or TPS) can be used with a single rover or rover-base DGPS combinations. The following describes the steps required for measuring terrain and trees in the Marburg Open Forest.

* Start the X-Pad application

* Select the required job or create a new one

* To connect the equipment press Settings

## Station Coordinates and Orientation definition

* Go to Survey tab and tap Station setup

* Select No. Station position has to be calculated

* For Free station, Instr. Height makes no sence (only if the ground point elevation will be used), thus, go Next

## Shooting/Measuring


* In Survey tab, press survey points, by default measures are conducted with the prism
